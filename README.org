* My technical blog

View it here: https://n-hebert.github.io/

I'm using OrgMode to write these and publish them to the Jekyll posts folder.

** Capturing a new blog
Define the following in your ELISP environment and bind or call `my/create-new-blog`.
You will be requested to provide a short title for the filename, a full title for public visiblity, and then the tags.
You can then write the blog.

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun my/determine-blog-org-capture-filename ()
    (let*
        ((my-org-note--name (replace-regexp-in-string " +" "-" (read-string "File-name (short title): ")))
         (my-org-note--time (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"))
         (file-name (format "%s/%s-%s.org" "~/eph/dev/local/n-hebert.github.io/org/posts" my-org-note--time my-org-note--name)))
      ;; I don't like how this opens a second window, it find-files away from where I am and then the capture opens a new window.
      (set-buffer (org-capture-target-buffer file-name))
      (goto-char (point-max))))

  (defun my/create-new-blog ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((org-capture-templates
           '(("b" "Blog (Professional)" plain
              (function my/determine-blog-org-capture-filename)
              (file "~/eph/dev/local/n-hebert.github.io/org/template.org")
              :unnarrowed t))))
      (org-capture nil "b")))
#+end_src

** Publishing a Post

See org/publish.el in this repo for details.

Do note that some trivial diffs currently pop up.

** Linking between pages
   Take a look at the output format, the date string gets turned into a directory.
Links therefore need to look like `[../../YYYY/MM/DD/title.html]`, not the default link that Org will put.
I'm sure there's a way to fix those on the org-publish, but it's not done yet.
